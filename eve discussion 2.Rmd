## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#NOTES

##Generalized HW
HW doesn't hold when there's deviation from random mating: ie. inbreeding
p <- AA
q <- aa
F <- probability of sampling 2 alleles inbred by descent (IBD)
homozygotes
heterozygotes
autozygotes <- AA due to IBD alleles
get an autozygote by:
Fp+(1-F)*p^2

aa <- F(1-p)+(1-F)*(1-p)^2
Aa <- (1-F)2p(1-p)
everything reduces to HW if F is 0
if F>0 then there's a decrease in heterozygosity

Aa <- f_12
F statistics come from comparing to refrence populations

what does it mean to be inbred: you sample someone from Britain and someone from somewhere else and look at their relatedness
2 people from Britain will be more inbred than one from Britain and one from Africa
F_IS <- 1-[f_12/2*p_s*q_s]
F_IT <- 1-[f_12/2*p_s*q_s]
F_ST <- 1-[2*p_s*q_s/2*p_t*q_t]
(1-F_IT)=(1-F_IS)*(1-F_ST)
genetic differentiation is gretest within a population than it is between subpopulations


#Linkage Disequilibrium
##Random Variable (rv)
Events <- a variable
event:  variable:   prob
H           1         p
T           0       (1-p)

for continuously distributed traits: the P(being 6'2) is 0
P(a</=X</=b)=f(integral)f(x)dx
P(50<y<80)=Z(summation)p(x)

variance
V(x)=summation(x_i-u_x)^2*p(x=x_i)
v(ax+b)=a^2*V(x)


E(ax+b)=aE(x)+b


if events are dependent: do not multiply
P(x,y)=/= p(x)*p(y)
only if events are independent 


P(x)=summation P(X=x,Y=y)
, means and in joint distribution speak
that x AND all possible y's


#Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)
D=P_AB-p_a*p_b
observed-expected

coupling gametes: AB and ab
repulsion gamets: Ab and aB

If D>0 excess of coupling gametes
D<0 excess of repulsion gametes to coupling gametes
D=0 if they assort independently

covariance(x,y)=E[(x-u_x)*(y-u_y)]
summarizes linear dependence
no covariance =/=no dependence
doesn't mean they're independent
dependence can be curvilinear not linear!
the F statistics, covariance between gametes in a zygote; what does it tell us about the pop? IBD, how you get dependence
D is a direct measure of covariance, as is F
